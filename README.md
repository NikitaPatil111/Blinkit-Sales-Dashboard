# Blinkit-Sales-Dashboard

This BlinkIT dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of grocery sales data, enabling a clear understanding of business performance and customer preferences. It includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales ($1.2M), average sales per transaction ($141), total items sold (8523), and average customer rating (4.0).

Interactive filters allow users to refine insights by outlet size (High, Medium, Small), outlet type (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket), and item categories (e.g., Fruits, Dairy, Snacks). Visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and horizontal graphs display data such as sales distribution by outlet size and location, fat content preference (Low Fat vs. Regular), and top-performing item categories.

The dashboard is visually appealing and user-friendly, providing actionable insights for decision-making and enhancing operational efficiency across outlets. Its design emphasizes clarity and aligns with BlinkIT's branding.
